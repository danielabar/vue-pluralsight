# Single Page Applications with Vue.js

> Notes from Pluralsight [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vue-js-single-page-applications/table-of-contents)

## Environment Setup - Build Process

### Project Files

Project [src](https://github.com/bstavroulakis/vue-spa)

![git-modules](course-images/git-modules.png "git-modules")

### Package Management

Use `npm init -y` to start a project accepting defaults.

Course is using this version of vue:

```shell
npm install vue@2.4.2 --save
```

### Web Server

This course will use express for both dev and production.


```shell
npm install express@4.15.4 --save
```

[server.js](server.js)

Start server:

```shell
nodemon server.js
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Web Server - Index.html

Use node's `fs` (file system) module to return `index.html` on any GET request.

Use npm scripts section to make shortcuts of commonly used commands.

### Webpack - Setup

![build-process](course-images/build-process.png)
For browsers, need a module bundler. For this course, will use Webpack as module bundler, and use various plugins to transpile, minify, and run other build processess.

[Base webpack config](build/webpack.base.config.js)

Specific version of webpack used for this course:

```shell
npm install webpack@3.5.5 --save-dev
```

Webpack file has a `config` json that includes all settings needed for webpack.

Webpack modules start with `entry`.

`output` sets path of generated output files (polyfilled code), to `dist` dir, which will be accessed via root path.
`[name]` will be filled in with `app` from `entry` section.

To run webpack:

```shell
node ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack --config ./build/webpack.base.config.js
```

To start using vue, import it in [src/app.js](src/app.js), initialize it, export it, then import app in [src/client-entry.js](src/client-entry.js).

Client entry mounts vue app into a dom element that must exist in index.html:

```javascript
app.$mount('#app');
```

Update [server.js](server.js) to use express static module to serve anything in dist dir.

### Dev Middleware

Inconvenient to have to restart web server on every change and re-run webpack build.

Install a few webpack plugins to make development more efficient:

```shell
npm install webpack-dev-middleware@1.12.0 webpack-hot-middleware@2.18.2 --save-dev
```

With dev middleware, dist files are not created on disk, but in memory. And only module that has changed will be rebuilt.
Hot middleware will reload only section that has changed in bundle.

Use the middleware in [build/dev-server.js](build/dev-server.js).

To be sure dist files are being loaded from memory, delete `dist` dir and run `npm start`. (no longer need separate step to run webpack build).

Notice output of webpack build, this time bundle is generated at `assets/js/app.js`, not `dist/assets/js/app.js`. Need to update script tag in index.html.

Now you can change module, for example string in app.js and webpack build will automatically re-run. Still need to refresh browser to see change.

### Hot Reloading
